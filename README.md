# The Study Portal:



The project aims to ease the work of students. Instead of visiting several sites, 'The Study Portal' is a one-stop solution for it. Containing several features and a user-friendly UI.
The student portal can bring all the tabs to a single site. From homework to to-do list to getting YouTube videos and making notes and making list of blogs/articles/books that you want to read, everything will be saved in one place. With a fully flexible authentication system.

## Agile:


This project was created using Agile principles via a project board on GitHub. This is the first time I have implemented Agile as an individual developer. However, creating user stories and identifying acceptance criteria acted as a roadmap to target the various features and functionalities of the application. It helped me stay on track and reduced distractions.

## Future Features:


-	Implement Ask me chatbot feature for user.
*	Allow user to add profile picture and more user specific information.
+	Display user progress using material design like charts.


## Challenges/Issues we ran into:


-	Merging the frontend part with the Django backend was messy
*	Due to lack of time i had to rush up my work (Time management was a huge problem)
+	Using Django defined user model for user registration I found quite confusing.
-	Deployment with Heroku was also quite challenging .

 

## How I Solve It:

-	Solved most of the CSS issues with Bootstrap.
*	Made a lot of error while developing and deploying, got over with some hit and trails.
+	Learning from previous experience specially hackathon helped a lot from model creation to deployment.
